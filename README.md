# Portfolio Assignment - Mobile-First and Responsive Design

# Your professional online presence

The portfolio site that you create will highlight your projects and your interests, and showcase your skills to potential employers or clients.

You will create, from scratch, a static portfolio site (no "backend server" code required), to represent your personal online presence.

Some hints to get going:

- Start a fresh new repository for this project on GitHub.
- This app will be structured very similarly to the blog code you worked with in your pair assignment.
- Start with a **rough** pen & paper "wireframe" sketch of what you want your portfolio site to look like.
- Work through as many of the user stories as you can, but always submit what you have by the due date. Don't let "if only..." ideas keep you from turning something in!
- Add the [.eslintrc](https://github.com/codefellows-seattle-301d7/01-mobile-first/blob/master/.eslintrc) config file to the root of your repo, so we are all on the same linter settings.
- Also include a [.gitignore](https://github.com/codefellows-seattle-301d7/01-mobile-first/blob/master/.gitignore) file in your root directory to prevent non-relevant files from being pushed to GitHub.

## User Stories: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Let these user stories guide your development:
 1. As a developer, I need my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
 1. As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me, and I can build my audience.
 1. As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.
 1. As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive with a menu, so that I can get around using any device.

## User Stories: Stretch Goals (*not required*)
  1. As a visitor, I want to see projects one per row on mobile, so that I can read the detail easily.

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
 - Be sure to use proper `viewport` settings.
 - Use mobile-first design principles when adding CSS.
 - Add new styles in any media queries as needed to make the page look good on desktop screens.
